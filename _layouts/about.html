            Hi, I’m Eammon Littler. I’m a recent graduate of Wheaton College MA and headed to Dartmouth for a Master's in Computer Science with a concentration in digital arts. While I grew up in warm and sunny Southern California, I recently moved to Burlington Vermont.

            I’ve always been a maker, creating marble towers as a kid and playing with 3D printers as an adult. As a maker, the open-source community is very important to me. It’s where I’ve learned a lot of the skills I have today. To give back to the community, I’ve worked towards creating clear guides for every project I post. Currently, my site is filled with 3D printing content however, I have begun exploring ways to create interactive/useful webpage tools. Figma is my favorite website prototyper and GitHub pages help run my sites easily.

            My current interests include 3D design, electronics, cooking, and photography. I’m into fermentation and usually keep a jar of sprouting greens nearby. My sprouts seem healthy, but I can’t say the same for my water kefir...
